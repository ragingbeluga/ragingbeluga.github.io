## 1. Don't Do Things That Make You Guilty.

Dont do things that make you guilty. And if you do, don't feel guilty for things you have done. It's extremely counterproductive. Do something creative instead. Waste time creatively. Don't watch too much TV. Don't browse too much social media. Instead, do something less consumptive and more interactive and constructive. Like programming, painting, building etc. Not being guilty is really important. Having self-respect is more and more necessary. Doing creative work will give you the confidence you need to get out of Pleasure Island.
