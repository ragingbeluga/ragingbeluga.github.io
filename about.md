## 1. Don't do things that make you guilty.

Dont do things that make you guilty. Don't feel guilty for things you have done. Do something creative instead. Waste time creatively.Don't watch TV. Don't browse social media. Instead, do something less consumptive and more interactive and constructive. Like programming, painting, building etc. Not being guilty is really important. Having self-respect is more and more necessary. Doing creative work will give you the confidence you need.
